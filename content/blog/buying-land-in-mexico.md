The last few years have seen a record number of Americans heading to go live in Mexico. There are over 1.5 million ex-pats living throughout Mexico and tens of thousands living in Baja California. It is no wonder when the cost of living can be significantly less than that in the U.S. and with Mexico's top wine region just south of the border, living in a semi-perma-vacation is easily at hand.

Although foreign residents are allowed to own land fairly easily in Mexico, it is a bit of a different process than usual on Mexican land that is within 65 miles of the U.S. border or 35 miles of the Mexican coastline. In those areas, Americans can own and build on land through a trust called fideicomiso through a bank. This renewable and transferrable bank trust allow foreigners to absolute and irrevocable property ownership rights in Mexico, allowing you to buy, sell and lease the property. Aside from these special areas, buying in Mexico is usually the same as in the U.S.
