The last few years have seen a record number of Americans heading south to go live in Mexico. There are over 1.5 million ex-pats living throughout Mexico and tens of thousands living in Baja California. It is no wonder when the cost of living can be significantly less than costs in the U.S. and with Mexico's top wine region just south of the border, living in a semi-perma-vacation is easily at hand. You will find the dollar goes further, the costs of living are lower and will usually afford you a better quality of life. It's no wonder why many are choosing to head down south permanently or consider keeping that option at hand by buying a property in Baja or further inland.
